# Pathfinding

This repo is to explore A* pathfinding. My goal is to implement A* in typescript and then to explore further topics to optimise A* using visibility graphs and navigation meshes.

TODO

- add cost from entity.
- add buttons to switch tile type.
- add debug view to see which tiles are visited by the a* algorithm.
- add some profiling
- add optimisations like visibility graphs and navigation meshes.
- add tiles with weights
- optimise data structure - use a heap instead of an array.
