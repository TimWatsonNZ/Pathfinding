# Pathfinding

This repo is to explore A* pathfinding. My goal is to implement A* in typescript and then to explore further topics to optimise A* using visibility graphs and navigation meshes.

TODO

- add optimisations like visibility graphs and navigation meshes.
- add tiles with weights
- optimise data structure - use a heap instead of an array and a hashtable? Profile before and after.
